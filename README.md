# Login to TahirGPT Page

## Overview

This is a simple login and registration system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to register with their email and password, which are then stored in the browser's LocalStorage for validation during login. The login page includes features for switching between the login and register forms and provides a basic authentication mechanism.

Upon successful login, users are redirected to a chatbot page, **TahirGPT**, where they can interact with the AI assistant.
